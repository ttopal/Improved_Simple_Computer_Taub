# Improved_Simple_Computer_Taub
DIGITAL CIRCUITS AND MICROPROCESSORS H. TAUB Book Chapter 9
 designing a computer or other digital processor generally
 begins with considering the architecture.
  Architectural structures are generally arrived at on
 the basis of the designer's experience and often by simply "improving" an exist
ing design. An improvement of the system of Fig. 8.8-1 is shown in Fig. 9.1-1.
 As we may well expect generally, improvements, which allow a system to do
 more, lead to more complexity.
